This project is the final capstone for Microverse, and it was made for learning purposes.
The project works in conjunction with an API that was built specifically for this project.
There can be Admin and regular profiles.
The regular profile can see the list of all trips, modify the profile and manage a personal favorite list.
Additionally, from the regular actions, the Admin profile can update and edit trip deals.
The only way to make an Admin profile is through the API, and is explained [here.](https://github.com/AlejandroNo4/capstone-api)
